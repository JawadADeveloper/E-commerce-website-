The HTML and CSS for the project have just been completed.

We divided our project into five sections from the start.

 - Header
 - HERO
 - PRODUCT
 - OFFER
 - FOOTER

We still have two remaining pages, one of which uses JS logic.

For example, if someone clicks on a product, they are taken directly to that product's page.

The customer will be able to place the order and receive a tracking number as well as some additional information.

A tracking details option can be found on the second page. When someone inputs the tracking number which we provide, they will be informed about their purchase.
